Ataree - eBPF-based Monitoring Tool
===================================

This is a project that uses a the ebpf virtual machine to hook programs in kernel space to common syscalls...etc. These events will be directed to userland for processing using Golang.

Backlog (things we should work on)
----------------------------------

1.  [x] Initialize Go module and project structure (`cmd/`, `internal/`).
2.  [x] Add `cilium/ebpf` dependency.
3.  [ ] Write minimal eBPF C program (tracepoint `sys_enter_execve`).
4.  [ ] Define shared event struct (C + Go).
5.  [ ] Compile eBPF program to `.o`.
6.  [ ] Load eBPF object in Go.
7.  [ ] Attach program to tracepoint.
8.  [ ] Create ring buffer reader.
9.  [ ] Parse events and print PID + command.
10. [ ] Implement graceful shutdown (SIGINT handling).

That’s Sprint 1. Other stuff would have to wait.
